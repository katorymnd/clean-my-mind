# 🧠 Clean My Mind

> *“The mind doesn’t need more apps. It needs space to breathe.”*

**Clean My Mind** is not an app.  
It’s a daily ritual — a quiet mirror for your thoughts.

No AI. No notifications. No cloud.  
Just you, your journal, and five minutes of honesty.

## What This Tool Does (In 3 Lines)

1. **Dumps** the noise from your head into a private text input — no filters, no judgment.  
2. **Focuses** you with silent 5-25-5 cycles — no distractions, just breath and stillness.  
3. **Reveals** patterns in your thinking — not with charts, but with repetition you can *feel*.

All data stays on your device.  
No server. No tracking. No sales pitch.

## Why This Exists

Most tools promise to “organize your mind.”  
They add tabs, tags, reminders, syncs — more clutter.

This tool does the opposite:  
It removes everything except the act of **speaking honestly to yourself**.

It was built for:
- The developer who stares at their screen until 2am  
- The student drowning in unspoken anxiety  
- The parent who hasn’t heard their own voice in weeks  
- Anyone who feels like their thoughts are screaming… but no one’s listening
