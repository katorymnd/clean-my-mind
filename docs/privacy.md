# Privacy Policy

At **Clean My Mind**, your privacy is not an afterthought — it is the foundation of the app’s design.

### 1. No Tracking, No Profiling
- We do not use analytics, advertising trackers, or profiling systems.  
- Your activity is never sold or shared with third parties.  

---

### 2. Local-First Data
- All reflections, notes, and personal inputs are stored **locally on your device** by default.  
- You are always in control of your own data.  

---

### 3. Secure Interactions
- Optional interactions with our server (such as login or top-up) are **end-to-end encrypted**.  
- No unnecessary metadata is retained beyond what is required to complete the request.

### 4. Use of Email
- Your email is used only for:  
  - Sending a one-time **magic link** to access your session.  
  - Sending **top-up confirmations** if you purchase premium features.  
- We never send marketing emails or newsletters without your explicit consent.  

---

### 5. Data Retention
- No permanent personal records are maintained on our servers.
