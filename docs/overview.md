# Overview

**Clean My Mind** is not a social network or a data-hungry service.  
It is a silent ritual that lives on your machine.

It runs locally — no feeds, no ads, no third parties.  
Your thoughts remain yours. Always.

### Core Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Bound to You** | A one-time **magic link** sent to your email binds your session to this device. No passwords, no accounts to manage. |
| **No Cloud Sync** | All entries stay local in plain text. Nothing is uploaded by default. |
| **Minimal Identity** | Your email is used only for the magic link. There is no profile, no friends list, no tracking. |
| **No Tracking** | Zero analytics. No telemetry. Not even a “was this helpful?” nudge. |
| **No Premium Tiers** | No locked features. You pay per ritual or for exports, not for status symbols. |
| **Minimalist by Design** | One command. One file. One quiet moment. No clutter, no distractions. |

This tool is for those who have tried every productivity app —  
and still feel crowded inside their own mind.

It asks nothing of you but honesty.  
And gives back only clarity.
